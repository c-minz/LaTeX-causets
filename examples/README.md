# Examples
This directory contains more causet diagrams created with the `causets` package.

## Series of all causets with one to six events
The number of finite causets is given by the sequence of numbers of partially ordered sets with n unlabeled elements, see https://oeis.org/A000112.
All causets up with less than six events embed in 2-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and can be printed with the command `\pcauset`.
Among the causets with six events, there are three causets that do not embed in 2-dimensional but in 3-dimensional Minkowski spacetime (these are drawn with `\rcauset`).
All diagrams (including the permutation grid) are shown in the files
